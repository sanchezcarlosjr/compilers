README file for Programming Assignment 1
========================================

Your directory should now contain the following files:

 build.xml
 runmips.py
 coolc.py
 coolc.jar
 trap_handler.mars
 README
 atoi.cl
 stack.cl
 stack.test
 PA1.pdf
 cool-manual.pdf

	build.xml contains targets for compiling and testing your
	program. DO NOT MODIFY.

        runmips.py is a script to run a mips assembly file on the MARS 
        mips emulator. DO NOT MODIFY.

        coolc.py is a script to drive the compiler. DO NOT MODIFY.

        coolc.jar is a jar file containing a coolc compiler reference
        implementation and the MARS mips emulator. DO NOT MODIFY.

        trap_handler.mars is a trap handler implementation required
        by the MART mips emulator. DO NOT MODIFY.

	README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	answer the questions at the end of this README file.
	Just edit this file.

	atoi.cl is an implementation in Cool of the string to integer
	conversion function known from the C language.

	stack.cl is the skeleton file which you should fill in with
	your program.

	stack.test is a short test input to the stack machine. It is
	run through your program when you hand it in, and the output
	is also	handed in.

        PA1.pdf is the specficiation of the first programming assignment.
        Please read it carefully.

        cool-manual.pdf is the specification of the cool language syntax
        and semantics. Please read it carefully.


System Requirements
-------------------

        If you want to use your own system for the development, you will
        need to install following programs before starting the assignment.

  JDK version 1.7 (Java 7 Development Kit)
  Apache Ant 1.7 (or newer)
  Python 2.7

        After installing a package, please put the path to the bin folder 
        of the installed package in your PATH variable. I.e., "java", "ant",
        and "python" commands should run without the exact path to the
        corresponding bin folder. You also need to set "JAVA_HOME" and
        "ANT_HOME" environment variables. 

Instructions
------------

	To compile and test your program, type:

	% ant test

        Try it now -- it should work, and print "Nothing implemented"
        (among a few other things).


        To simply compile your program, type
        % python coolc.py stack.cl atoi.cl

        And to run the program, type
        % python runmips.py stack.s

	Instructions for turning in the assignment are given in the handout.

	GOOD LUCK!
